# Cyber Security Internship – Task 4

## Task Title
Password Security & Authentication Analysis

## Objective
To understand how passwords are stored, attacked, and protected, and to analyze best practices for secure authentication.

## What I Did
- Studied hashing vs encryption
- Identified common password hash types
- Learned why weak passwords are easily cracked
- Understood brute force and dictionary attacks conceptually
- Analyzed the importance of salting and slow hashing algorithms
- Studied the role of multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Documented strong authentication recommendations

## Tools Studied
- Hashcat
- John the Ripper
- Online hash identification tools

## Deliverables
- Password security analysis report
- Supporting notes and screenshots
- Sample (non-sensitive) hash data for learning

## Outcome
Developed a clear understanding of password attacks, defenses, and modern authentication best practices.
